2019-05-07: Initial commit with PHP-ready version
---
1) uses bootstrap 4.3.1, jquery 3.3.1, php 7, fontawesome 5.8.1
2) using a position fixed video on homepage
3) all files separated into specific folders

TODO:
1) create page for each menu entry
2) create a login page (maybe node with passport, otherwise php with mysql)
3) member area (after login) requires a filestructure separated from normal workflows - subdomain, maybe?
4) db architecture needs to be established
